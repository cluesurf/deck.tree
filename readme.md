  The TextTree Package Manager
</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Usage

This library is used internally by the
[compiler for TextTree](https://github.com/cluesurf/mesh.tree), where it
finds the files that are referenced. It is also used by
[base](https://github.com/cluesurf/base) itself, to fetch the files when
installing.

## Theory

It is built upon
[`@cluesurf/deck`](https://github.com/cluesurf/deck.js), which aims to
be a language-agnostic package manager in the long run.

### Specification

```tree
deck @cluesurf/base
  head <A TreeCode Framework>

  mark <0.0.1>
  sort tool

  lock apache-2

  site <https://github.com/cluesurf/base>
  view ./view/tree.gif

  term tree-code
  term computation
  term information
  term philosophy
  term platform
  term white-label
  term compiler

  deck ./deck/load
  deck ./deck/line

  # defaults to https://registry.npmjs.org registry
  link @cluesurf/bind, mark <0.0.x>
  link @cluesurf/moon, mark <0.0.x>
  link @cluesurf/bead, mark <0.0.x>
  link @cluesurf/chew, mark <0.0.x>
  link @cluesurf/move, mark <0.0.x>
  link @cluesurf/base, site <git://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish>

  # use a custom registry
  host <https://npm.pkg.github.com>
    link @cluesurf/seal, mark <0.0.x>
    link @cluesurf/cone, mark <0.0.x>
    link @cluesurf/buzz, mark <0.0.x>
    link @cluesurf/crow, mark <0.0.x>

  task ./task # the task loader
  read ./book # also a default
  role ./role # also a default
  line ./line
  test ./test

```

### Fetching

Get the package metadata here:

```
https://registry.npmjs.org/lodash/4.17.21
https://registry.npmjs.org/@cluesurf/tree/1.1.0
```

Get the `.tgz` zip file of the NPM package here:

```
https://registry.npmjs.org/lodash/-/lodash-4.17.21.tgz
https://registry.npmjs.org/@cluesurf/tree/-/tree-1.1.0.tgz
```

```bash
shasum lodash-4.17.21.tgz === metadata.dist.shasum
```

To login to the GitHub registry, this is how it looks:

```bash
npm login --scope=@NAMESPACE --auth-type=legacy --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

### Storage

When you install packages, it hard symlinks them from your
`~/Library/base` folder to your `./link` folder.

```
~/Library/base/v000
  # global dependencies
  /hook
    /deck
      /<host+deck>
        /...files
        /link
          /base.js
          /package.json
  # shared dependencies
  /deck
    /<host+deck>
      /...files
      /link
        /base.js
        /package.json
  /file # file store
    /<hash-code>
      /<hash>.{js,tree}
```

```
./link
  /:host
    /:deck
      /:mark
```

Then, `/:host/:deck/:mark` is hard linked from:

```
~/Library/base/deck/:host+deck
```

And inside `~/Library/base/deck/*`, the files are hard linked to
`~/Library/base/file/:code/:hash`.

When you `base link <deck>`, it symlinks from the symlink inside of
`~/Library/base/deck/*`.

This handles:

- Globally installed decks go into `hook/link`.
- The rest of the installed decks get shared in `link`.

#### Using `package.json`

It installs them from any available NPM compatible hosting service, like
npmjs.org or github.com.

Here is the `package.json` that gets generated for the package.

```json
{
  "name": "@cluesurf/base",
  "base": true,
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

It simply uses the NPM ecosystem as a generic package hosting system.

#### Package size

Max package size is **8mb**, for packages published to NPM. This is
basically the same as what NPM enforces (they say they support 20mb, but
people have encountered errors publishing 10mb packages, so we choose
8mb).

Repos though, can be up to 1GB in size, and you can download these
through the `site <git://...>` directive.

### Searching

When it searches for files, it assumes the `CWD` is the deck base
folder, and so looks for the `./base.tree` file for that deck. It then
uses this information to determine the `role` of each nested file. Some
nested folders can also be nested decks, so those are determined too at
this point.

It then looks for the `link/lock.tree` file to make sure it is a folder
which contains installed decks. The `link` folder can be customized
using the `hold link` tree code.

```
/something/deeply/nested.tree
/something/deeply/nested/base.tree
```

### Lockfile

This is saved as `link/lock.tree`:

```tree
base <0.0.1>

load @cluesurf/moon
  mark <*>
  lock <0.0.1>
load @cluesurf/base
  mark <*>
  lock <0.0.1>
load @cluesurf/wolf
  mark <*>
  lock <0.0.1>

link <@cluesurf/wolf:0.0.1>
  hash <sha512-O8jcjabXaleOG9DQ0+ARXWZBTfnP4WNAqzuiJK7ll44AmxGKv/J2M4TPjxjY3znBCfvBXFzucm1twdyFybFqEA==>
  load @cluesurf/base
    mark <0.0.1>
```

### Linkfile

This is saved as `link/base.tree`

```tree
# says which ones are symlinks
link <@cluesurf/wolf:0.0.1>
link <@cluesurf/bind:0.0.1>
```

## ClueSurf

This is being developed by the folks at [ClueSurf](https://clue.surf), a
California-based project for helping humanity master information and
computation. ClueSurf started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an
idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a
seed of a project just beginning its development phases. It is entirely
bootstrapped by working full time and running
[Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/cluesurf) and
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also
find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/cluesurf),

other GitHub projects as well!
